In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.\n(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\n(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.\n(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months \nDNI.\nIn cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes\nit clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality.

Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"turbot catches\" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:\n*Turbot increased in catches.\nTwo more complications arise.

The Attribute could be overtly specified:\n(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.\nUnder another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"the population of Smallville\" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer \"of Smallville\" is tagged as Item. \n(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\n(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.\nSupport for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).\n(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.\nThe last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.\n(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\n(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.\nThere is no Attribute \"1999 price\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001.

The Cognizer may also remember  the Salient_entity in a particular State, which serves as a frame of reference in the Cognizer's mind.   When attention is focused on a Salient_entity, then mention of a global Experience is excluded and typically, but not always, either a State or Impression of the Salient_entity is presented.\n\nEpisodic memory is the  explicit memory of events. It includes time, place, and associated emotions (which affect the quality of the memorization). Episodic memory contrasts and interacts with semantic memory, the memory of facts and concepts. The Remembering_information frame is concerned with this latter type of memory.\nKozmo could remember when his modem was the fastest he could buy.\nThat's probably before my time, which was long time ago, Fish may remember that time.\nWho remembers me being a total dork and going up to everyone saying \"Hey, I'm Ashley Hunt from Chicago\"!?!\n I wanted to remember how good that felt.\nHummel says staff, both students and professional, remember\n her as a \"very good friend, available for new staff and well-respected by everyone.\"\nSomehow I remember him as older, with long eyelashes, and doe eyes.\nWhen he died he was just a kid himself but for some reason at the age of 44 I still remember him as older than me. \nRetro games are great, but a lot of the time people get clouded by nostalgia and remember them to be better than they really were\nHe remembered him as a kindly man but not a very lively one. \nThe part I vividly remember was about a South Seas tramp steamer captain .

Bill remembers her as smarter than she is.\n2b.*Bill remembers that she is smarter than she is.\nThe (b) sentences, which belong in this frame, are less acceptable than the (a)-sentences as they suggest  that the Cognizer  takes their memory to be accurate while suggesting at the same time that the memory might be or is inaccurate. In the (a) sentences, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no contradiction as the remembering is taken to be subjective and not necessarily accurate.\n\nThe concealed question uses with personal names that occur in this frame are not always easy to distinguish from instances of the Remembering_experience frame where a Salient_entity alone is referred to in 3a and 3b, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no question of identity: remembering here means thinking of one's memories of the relevant person. 3c is different: the hearer is asked whether they know who the person is; it belongs in this frame.\n3a.
